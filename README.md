## Objective
This study employs machine learning regression techniques to analyze the relationship between students' study hours and their academic scores. We utilized two different regression models - Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression - to predict student performance based on their study time. The main objective is to determine which model provides better predictive accuracy and insights for educational planning.

## Goals
- To analyze the relationship between study hours and academic performance using machine learning regression models and decision tree
- To compare the effectiveness of Linear Regression and Decision Tree models in predicting student scores
- To identify the most accurate model for educational performance prediction

## Conclusion
Based on analysis comparing Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, Linear Regression is the better model for predicting student scores from study hours. With an R-squared value of 0.955, it shows that study time strongly influences test scores
